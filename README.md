A bot which will show up all the live cricket matches scores and recently ended matches. Try it now [@askRijo]() {not yet hosted}

# Project Info
- I combined the power of webscrapping and telegram api to build this Bot
- Meanwhile, this **idea is inspired from _my friend_** [SivaRK](https://github.com/sivajayaraman) who he built this cricket-score bot with the commands. I remodelled it to GUI based one and more user-friendly.
- Started to build a mutli-function bot which features Cricket-score, Anna-univ updates, Facts about this day and Game bot. But ended with this.
- Working on to build that multi-function bot
